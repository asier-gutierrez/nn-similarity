# Characterizing and Measuring the Similarity of Neural Networks with Persistent Homology
This repository contains the code for our paper: "Characterizing and Measuring the Similarity of Neural Networks with Persistent Homology". This code transforms a trained Neural Network (NN) into a directed graph, performs the Persistent Homology computations and calculates distances across the different trained NNs. This process is done 5 times to validate the result and reduce the variation.

## Computational Requirements
This code requires large Random Access Memory (RAM). We used a machine of 1.5TB of RAM and 128 physical processor cores.

We suggest using either a Cloud Computing Machine (Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, IBM Cloud or similar) or reducing the network capacity.
